### An Analysis of NFL Team Spending and Wins On The Field

### Team Members:
* Binh Do
* Dan Dreger
* Anthony Jordan
* Brandon Macchi
* Andrew Oceguera

## Project Overview and Questions:
This project explores the correlation of NFL (National Football League) team success based on how they choose to allocate their yearly player budget, aka salary cap. Our questions:
* Will a team be more successful by having 1 or 2 very highly paid, highly skilled players on the roster taking up large portions of salary cap?
* Is it better to try and spread salary cap more evenly among players?
* What about offense and defense...? Is it better to invest more heavily in one over the other?

## Why NFL Spending?
* As a group of avid sports fans, we wanted to take on a project worthy of a Pro Sports front office.
* We’re interested in learning more about why some teams win and others do not.
* NFL contract data is ready accessible and available
